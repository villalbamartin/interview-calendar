# interview-calendar

A repository with exercise code for an interview at a company that will remain unnamed.
Since this repository can't be private, and I don't want to make it easy for future candidates to copy-paste code,
the instructions here will remain vague enough as to be unsearchable. Sorry!

## Requirements
  * The API web interface is provided using Flask and Flask-restful. Of course, you can also set your own server.
  * The database backend is currently implemented with SQLite.

## Running from the command line
The API can be accessed directly from the command line, or via web.
To run the API from the command line, run `calendar_cli.py`, and check the command line help for available commands.
To can send requests to the web API via `curl`.
